# RealPython

**_Real Python_** is a 3-course Python series of tutorial ebooks that I purchased from the [Real Python website](https://realpython.com/?utm_source=fsp&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=frontpage). The authors describe it as 
> "Python Programming By Example.... Real Python teaches Python and web development from the ground up, everything from the basic primitives to web scraping to data visualization and all things web development!"

### What's in this repo?
It is where I will store **_my solution code_** for assignments I've done in the "Real Python" series. The Real Python creators' code can be found in [the Real Python repo](https://github.com/realpython).
